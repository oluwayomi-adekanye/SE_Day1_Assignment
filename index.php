Gods is good
all the time
He has been marvelous in my life
I love Him so much
God im sorry for all my transgressions
forgive me for all my sins
I accept Jesus as my personal Lord and Saviour
Come into my life and sup with me
Wash me clean
Purge me whiter than snow
write my name in the book of life
I am save by faith
not by merit but by God's grace
